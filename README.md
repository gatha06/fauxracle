# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Name: [Gatha]


### Project Description
[Fauxracle is a fun and useless web app that scans your selfie and gives you a totally random aura reading.
It acts like it knows your vibe, but really, it‚Äôs just guessing ‚Äî with style. No real science, no accuracy ‚Äî just pure chaotic energy for your¬†entertainment.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Fauxracle tackles the pressing crisis of spiritual FOMO by giving you an aura reading no one asked for.
It solves the problem of having a face and not knowing what imaginary energy color it radiates.
Finally ‚Äî a tool for people who want vibes,¬†not¬†facts.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Fauxracle solves it by using your webcam to "analyze" your face and instantly generate a completely made-up aura.
It combines random selection with overconfident delivery to make the result feel oddly believable.
No data, no science ‚Äî just chaotic fun dressed up as spiritual¬†insight.]
